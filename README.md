# dynamete_iteration
Code implementing the iteration scheme for DynaMETE (Harte, Umemura, and Brush 2021)

This code is explained in Chapter 3 of my Dissertation: Macroecological Patterns Out of Steady State.

The Iteration notebook shows how to iterate the theory after perturbation with the transition functions as in the initial paper.
The FlexibleFunctions notebook uses code written so that the transition functions can be of any form. It is much slower, but more flexible.
